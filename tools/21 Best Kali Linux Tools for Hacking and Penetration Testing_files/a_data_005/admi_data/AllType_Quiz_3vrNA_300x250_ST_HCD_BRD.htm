 should discuss the potential benefits and risks of HUMIRA with your 
doctor. HUMIRA is a TNF blocker medicine that can lower the ability of 
your immune system to fight infections. You should not start taking 
HUMIRA if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is 
okay.<p></p><ul><li><strong>Serious infections have happened in people 
taking HUMIRA. These serious infections include tuberculosis (TB) and 
infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that have spread 
throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections.</strong>
 Your doctor should test you for TB before starting HUMIRA, and check 
you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with HUMIRA, 
even if your TB test was negative. If your doctor feels you are at risk,
 you may be treated with medicine for TB.</li><li><strong>Cancer.</strong>
 For children and adults taking TNF blockers, including HUMIRA, the 
chance of getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. There have 
been cases of unusual cancers in children, teenagers, and young adults 
using TNF blockers. Some people have developed a rare type of cancer 
called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results 
in death. If using TNF blockers including HUMIRA, your chance of getting
 two types of skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell) may increase. 
These types are generally not life-threatening if treated; tell your 
doctor if you have a bump or open sore that doesn’t heal.</li></ul><p></p><span class="stop">Scroll down for more Important Safety Information.</span><p id="stop"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><span class="subheader">What should I tell my doctor BEFORE starting HUMIRA?</span><p></p><p></p><strong>Tell your doctor about all of your health conditions,</strong> including if you:<p></p><ul><li>Have an infection, are being treated for infection, or have symptoms of an infection</li><li>Get a lot of infections or infections that keep coming back</li><li>Have diabetes</li><li>Have
