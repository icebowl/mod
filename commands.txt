oidof    Pidof finds the process id's (pids) of the named  programs.  It  prints
       those id's on the standard output. This program is on some systems used
       in run-level change scripts, especially when the system has a  System-V
       like   rc  structure.  In  that  case  these  scripts  are  located  in
       /etc/rc?.d, where ? is the runlevel. If the system  has  a  start-stop-
       daemon (8) program that should be used instead.
